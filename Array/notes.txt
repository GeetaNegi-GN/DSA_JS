Array -:Sometimes called as a list organizes items sequencially one after another in memory.
lookup => O(1)
push => O(1)
insert => O(n)
delete => O(n)
 

There are two types of array:
1:Static array
 -fixed memory

2:Dynamic array
-memory can be updated when req.

lookup => O(1)
append => O(1) *can be O(n)
insert => O(n)
delete => O(n)  


Hash Tables

Hash Function


lookup => O(1)
search => O(1)
insert => O(1)
delete => O(1)

pros-

cons-


colision

Arrays VS Hash Tables

Differences


similarities



Review--

Fast lookups*   (goood collision resolution neede)
fast inserts
flexible keys

downside of hashtable-:
unordered
Slow Key iteration



3. Linked Lists
Definition-



prepend => O(1)
append => O(1) 
lookup => O(n)
insert => O(n)
delete => O(n)


singly linked list

Doubly linked  list



singly linked list vs Doubly linked  list?



Why linked list is better than array and hash table or not+?


Pointer -
it is a reference for a memory,object..




linked list pros and cons
-Fast Insertion
-Fast Deletion
-Ordered
-Flexible Size

-Slow lookup
-More Memory




Stack and Queue - linear DS

Stack -LIFO
lookup => O(n)
pop => O(1)
push => O(1)
peek => O(1)


Example-

Queues - FIFO 
lookup => O(n)
enqueue => O(1)
dequeue => O(1)
peek => O(1)

Example-

pros and cons-
Fast operations
fast peek
Ordered

slow lookup


Can be implement by arrays and linked list
